# Munispora-project
A possible alternative socio-economic model for a global network of resiliant sustainable communities
Muni from municipal and Spora from the dispersion of spores that create mycellium like networks

There are many movements and organisations which describe a vision of an alternative social and economic system that is more collaborative and aligned with nature then our present day mostly variations of capitalism, but many do not detail much substancially in any strategy, concrete transtion plan or technological tools. 

The goal of this project is to define a specific viewpoint which addresses a transition strategy addressing economic and governance for a network of prosocial communities. The viewpoint is emergent and modular in scope, welcoming alternative ideas and strategies that resonate with the core group 

## components

- A global level perspective on how to transition to a greater world of abundance and symbiosis with nature/gaia (Abundance protocol)
- A local social transition framework for physical intentional communities (EICFF)
- A framework for inter-community collaboration and exchange of resources ( WeQuest)
- A suite of software tools to facilitate peer to peer and community interaction.
